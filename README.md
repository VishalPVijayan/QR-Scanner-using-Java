# QR-Scanner-using-Java
QR scanner application is developed in Java using the IDE Android Studio. This application uses Barcode scanner library for Android, based on the ZXing decoder. While this is not the primary purpose of this library, it does include basic support for generating some barcode types.
Dependency for ZXing Library  (implementation 'me.dm7.barcodescanner:zxing:1.9.13')
We can also add activities which will open up the scanned bar code result by adding a simple intent depending upon the use of application.
